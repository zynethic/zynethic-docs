# ⚖️ LEGAL DISCLAIMER & RISK DISCLOSURE

### 1. Institutional Framework
This document and the ZYNETHIC ecosystem are governed by the principle of transparency. **$ZNTC** is a utility and community governance token designed to serve as the fuel for the convergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Web3. It is not a security, financial instrument, or investment contract in any jurisdiction.

### 2. High-Growth Potential & Performance
While the ZYNETHIC roadmap is designed for aggressive global expansion and rapid AI model deployment, potential participants must understand that the cryptocurrency market is inherently volatile. The "Limitless Ceiling" vision of $ZNTC is based on the integration of AI utilities and community scaling; however, past performance or roadmap projections do not guarantee future price action.

### 3. "Code as Law" Integrity
By interacting with $ZNTC, you acknowledge that the protocol is **Immutable**. The fixed supply of 40,000,000 tokens and the zero-minting framework are mathematically hardcoded to protect holders from inflation. However, the decentralized nature of the Base Network means that participants assume all technical risks associated with blockchain interactions.

### 4. Strategic Risk Management
The ZYNETHIC team and community prioritize security through:
* **Contract Verification:** Full transparency on BaseScan.
* **Liquidity Safeguards:** Strategic locking mechanisms to prevent market manipulation.
* **Phased Rollout:** A structured 2026 Roadmap to ensure sustainable growth rather than temporary hype.

### 5. Forward-Looking Statements
Statements within this whitepaper regarding the **2026 Strategic Roadmap**, AI Dashboard launches, and CEX listings are "Forward-Looking Statements." These reflect our professional ambition and current development path. While we are committed to rapid evolution, these milestones are subject to technical feasibility and market conditions.

### 6. No Financial Advice
Nothing in this documentation constitutes financial or investment advice. We encourage every member of the global AI community to conduct their own due diligence (DYOR) before participating in the $ZNTC ecosystem.
